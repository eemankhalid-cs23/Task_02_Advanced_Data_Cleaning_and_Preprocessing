# Task 02 - Advanced Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Adult Census Income dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The preprocessing pipeline improves data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicate records, detecting outliers, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and validating the final dataset.

## Business Problem

An HR Analytics company wants to predict employee income using historical employee information. However, the dataset contains missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent formatting, and categorical features that cannot be directly used in machine learning models.

The objective of this project is to transform the raw dataset into a clean and machine-learning-ready dataset.

## Dataset

**Dataset Name:** Adult Census Income Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)

**Target Variable:**
- Income (`<=50K` or `>50K`)

---

## Objectives

- Explore the dataset
- Identify missing values
- Handle missing values using appropriate techniques
- Detect and remove duplicate records
- Analyze outliers using Box Plots and IQR
- Encode categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
- Scale numerical features using StandardScaler
- Validate the final dataset

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- VS Code

## Data Preprocessing Steps

- Dataset Exploration
- Missing Value Analysis
- Missing Value Imputation (Mode)
- Duplicate Detection and Removal
- Outlier Detection using Box Plots
- Outlier Analysis using IQR
- One-Hot Encoding
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Data Validation

## Results

After preprocessing:

- Missing Values = **0**
- Duplicate Records = **0**
- Final Dataset Shape = **(32537, 98)**

The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for machine learning model development.
